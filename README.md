This project focuses on creating a predictive model that detects likely machine failures in a manufacturing environment. The company produces high-precision metal components used in aerospace, automotive, and medical device applications. The challenge is to minimize machine downtime, which directly impacts production deadlines.

# Project Objective
Predictive Model: Train a predictive model using machine operational data to forecast machine failure.
Feature Analysis: Identify the dataset features that are the strongest predictors of machine failure.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and analyze the accuracy of predictions based on whether each machine is modeled separately.

## Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle any missing values or anomalies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might help the model, such as rolling averages, time-based features, etc.
Feature Scaling: Normalize/standardize features if necessary.

## Step 2: Model Training
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for this task. You can start with classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Train the model: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and train the model.
Cross-validation: Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
## Step 3: Evaluation
Accuracy Metrics: Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Feature Importance: Analyze which features are the strongest predictors of machine failure.
Model Comparison: Compare results from a model trained on all machines together versus models trained separately for each machine.
## Step 4: Reporting
Model Summary: Provide a summary of the model's performance.
Key Findings: Highlight the most important features for predicting machine failure.
Machine-specific Analysis: Discuss whether modeling each machine separately improves prediction accuracy.
